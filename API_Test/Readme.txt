Description: In the CRUD collection and the test automation for Petstore, I automated the Add Pet, Get Pet, Update Pet, and Delete Pet scenarios. In the Add Pet API endpoint, I assigned a random ID as a pre-request and created the pet with this ID. Then, I captured the generated ID from the POST response and stored it as a variable to be used in subsequent tests. I used this ID in the corresponding endpoints during the following test scenarios. Additionally, I added pm.test code to each test case to validate the expected responses in the test automation process.
